# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, quality, and relationships within a given dataset. The objective was to investigate key variables, detect potential data issues, and derive early insights to inform subsequent modeling or business decisions.

## Objectives

- Assess data quality: missing values, duplicates, data types, and outliers  
- Explore distributions and summary statistics of key features  
- Identify trends, correlations, and group-level comparisons  
- Create visualizations to support interpretability and presentation

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## EDA Techniques Applied

- Summary statistics and value counts for categorical features  
- Histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps for numeric exploration  
- Grouped comparisons using bar plots and pivot tables  
- Duplicate and null value analysis to ensure data readiness

## Key Findings

- Several features required type correction or handling of missing values  
- Strong correlation found between certain numerical variables  
- Clear differences observed in behavior between customer segments  
- Visual insights helped shape early hypotheses for modeling

## Next Steps

- Use findings to inform feature engineering for supervised models  
- Apply scaling, encoding, and data transformation as needed  
- Optionally incorporate advanced techniques (e.g., PCA, clustering) for further exploration
